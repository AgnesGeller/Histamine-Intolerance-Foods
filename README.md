# Histamine Intolerance Food List

This project is a web application that provides a list of foods that are medium or high in histamine levels. Histamine intolerance is a condition where the body cannot break down histamine properly, leading to symptoms such as headaches, rashes, itching, nausea, and more. By avoiding foods that trigger histamine release or contain high amounts of histamine, people with histamine intolerance can manage their condition better.
